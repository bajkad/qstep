Warwick Q-Step Masterclass: Quantitative Text Analysis
============

This page contains the program and material for the Quantitative Text Analysis masterclass.

Note that the tutorial material on this page is based on similar tutorials on the more general [R course material](tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started.md) page that my collegues and I maintain for these types of workshops. On this page we also update material based on new developments (or simpy when we have time to write better tutorials). Please use it if you are interested in material beyond the current workshop or at a later time.
